# Security Warning - Custom Authentication Implementation

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

This application now uses **custom client-side authentication** instead of Firebase Authentication due to Firebase quota limits. While functional, this implementation has significant security limitations.

### Current Implementation

**What's Changed:**
1. ✅ Custom authentication system (email/password with SHA-256 + salt hashing)
2. ✅ Screenshots sent directly to Telegram (bypassing Firebase Storage quota)
3. ✅ Firebase Realtime Database for data storage only
4. ✅ User data stored with salted password hashes

### Security Limitations

**⚠️ Critical Issues:**

1. **Client-Side Authentication**
   - Password verification happens in the browser
   - Users can inspect and modify authentication logic
   - No server-side validation

2. **Database Access**
   - Firebase Realtime Database security rules require Firebase Auth
   - Current rules allow any authenticated user to read/write data
   - Users could potentially access other users' data if rules aren't properly configured

3. **Password Storage**
   - While passwords use SHA-256 with salt, this is client-side hashing
   - More secure than plaintext, but not as secure as server-side bcrypt/Argon2
   - Hashes are stored in Firebase and localStorage

4. **No Rate Limiting**
   - No protection against brute force attacks
   - No account lockout after failed attempts

### Recommended Next Steps

**For Production Use:**

1. **Implement a Backend Server**
   - Use Node.js, Python Flask, or similar
   - Move authentication logic server-side
   - Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
   - Implement rate limiting and CORS

2. **Alternative: Use Third-Party Auth**
   - Consider Clerk, Auth0, or Supabase (many offer free tiers)
   - These provide secure authentication without Firebase Auth quota issues
   - Better security with less maintenance

3. **Update Firebase Security Rules**
   - Implement proper validation rules
   - Restrict access based on user ID
   - Add server-side validation for sensitive operations

4. **Add Security Measures**
   - Implement rate limiting on login attempts
   - Add CAPTCHA for signup/login
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement session timeout
   - Add two-factor authentication (2FA)

### Current Firebase Security Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** These rules expect Firebase Auth, which we're not using. You'll need to either:
- Keep Firebase Auth just for authentication tokens, OR
- Make database publicly readable/writable (VERY INSECURE), OR
- Implement a custom backend with Firebase Admin SDK

### What This Means for You

**For Testing/Development:** ✅ Current implementation works fine

**For Production:** ❌ Not recommended without additional security measures

**Recommendation:** This setup is suitable for:
- Learning projects
- Internal tools (not public-facing)
- Prototypes and MVPs

For a production app with real users and money involved, you should:
1. Set up a backend server for authentication
2. Or use a third-party auth service
3. Update Firebase Security Rules properly
4. Add rate limiting and other security measures
